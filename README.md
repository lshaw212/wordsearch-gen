# Word Search Generator :capital_abcd:
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Screenshot
Soon.

## Description
During the Covid-19 pandemic, I found myself doing more Crosswords, Sudoku and Wordsearches in my abundance of spare time. I decided I could code something related to that and just like that! the Word search generator was born. The project lets users select a grid size where they can then type in their own words or instead generate random words from a large list of words. After a puzzle has been generated the user can click/tap on the first and last letter of a word to guess from the word list. The idea is to create a puzzle that appears to be manmade, where words are placed in different orientations and locations to offer a unique feel each time they generate a word search. There is still a few features to be added to increased the scale of the project.

## Technologies
* React

## Features
* Create your own word search with three different grid sizes (6,9,12)
* Input a set amount of words depending on the size of the grid.
* There is an option to generate random words of different sizes to fill the grid instead.
* Words are placed in the word search in 8 different orientations.
  - Up, down, forward and backwards.
  - Diagonal in 4 directions.
* Click/tap to select a letter and then do the same to select a second to guess a word from the list.
* CSS Animations and transitions helps make the wordsearch feel interactive to the user.
* The user is able to play again as many times as they want, trying a different combination of words each time.

## To add..
* Project to be usable on mobile devices.
* A different animation for finding words on the grid.
* Sharing word searches via a unique URL for friends to try.

## Setup
If downloading the project run

`npm install`

to install the project and all the dependencies, followed by

`npm start`

to run the project on http://localhost:3000

When the project is live, create your word search by typing in words or click the generate button to fill up the input boxes with random words. Click or Tap on a word to select it and do the same to a second to guess a word from the list. You can create a new puzzle with the reset button, or click play again upon finishing the game.
